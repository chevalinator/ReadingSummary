The quotes below are what represents the essence of the book [Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition](https://www.amazon.ca/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Expanded-Hardcover/dp/1578645018). 

Some quotes have been sligtly modified to complete the meaning since they are sometimes taken out of context.

The emphasis represents the importance of the quote to me.

# Quotes
I think when you're trying to teach great concepts that work, it helps to tie them into the lives an personnalities of the people who developed them. I think you learn economics better if you make Adam Smith your friend. That sounds funny, making friends among 'the eminent dead,' but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life and work better in education. It's way better than just giving the basic concepts.

*Just as multiple factors shape almost every system, multiple models from a variety of disciplines, applied with fluency, are needed to understand a system.*

<br><br>

Charlie has developed an unusual additional attribute-a willingness, even an eagerness, to identify and acknowledge his own mistakes and learn from them. As he once said, "If Bershire has made a modest progress, a good deal of it is because Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year." 

<br><br>

Charlie likes the analogy of looking at one's ideas and approaches as "tools." "When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what couJd be better than to swap it for your old, less useful tool? Warren and I routinely do this, but most people, as Galbraith says, forever cling to their old, less useful tools."

<br><br>

__Charlie seek to discover the universe hitched to each of his investment candidates by gaining a firm grasp on all, or at least most, of the relevant factors comprising both its internal and external environment. When properly collected and organized, his Multiple Mental Models (about one hundred in number, he estimates) provide a context or " latticework" that leads to remarkable insights as to the purpose and nature of life. More pertinent to our purpose here, his models supply the analytical structure that enables him to reduce the inherent chaos and confusion of a complex investment problem into a clarified set of fundamentals. *Especially important examples of these models include the redundancy/backup system model from engineering, the compound interest model from mathematics, the breakpoint/tipping-moment/autocatalysis models from physics and chemistry, the modern Darwinian synthesis model from biology and cognitive misjudgment models from psychology.*__

 "Of course, the term Munger has coined for factors which reinforce and greatly amplify each orher is 'Lollapalooza Effect.'"__

 "Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not. It is the first lesson that ought to be learned and however early a man's training begins, it is probably the last lesson that he learn thoroughly."  
                         -Thomas Henry Huxley Darwin's self-appointed advocate or "bulldog"

__Often, as in this case, Charlie generally focuses first on what to avoid - that is, on what NOT to do - before he considers the affirmative steps he will take in a given situation.__

<br><br>

__"Personaly, I've gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions in various way - which, by and large, are useful - but which often malfunction? One approach is rationnality - the way you'd work out a bridge problem, by evaluating the real interest, the real probabilities, and so forth. And the other is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subcouscious conclusions - many are which are wrong."__

<br><br>

###### "We have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand." To identify potential "yes" candidates, Charlie looks for an easy to understand, dominant business franchise that can sustain itself and thrive in all market environments.

<br><br>

__Identifying Your circle of Competence__  
In Talk Nine (page 400), Charlie tells the apocryphal story of Max Planck and the chauffeur who drove him to the public lecture he gave throughout Germany. On one occasion the chauffeur, who by this time knew the lecture by heart, suggested that he and Planck switch places. At the conclusion of the chauffeur's flawless recitation of the lecture, a physicist stood up and posed a very difficult question. The chauffeur, ready for the situation, replied, "I'm surprised that a citizen of an advanced city like Munich is asking so elementary a question, so I'm going to ask my chauffeur ro respond." 
  
In the real world, it is critical to distinguish when you are "Max Planck," and when you are the "chauffeur." If you cannot respond legitimately to the *next* question, you lack true masrery and are likely outside your "Circle of Competence." 

<br><br>

###### Munger and Buffer are laser-focused on this issue: Over their long business careers they have learned, sometimes painfully, that few businesses survive over multiple gnenerations.

<br><br>

###### Charlie seeks to calculate the intrinsic value of the whole business and, with allowance for potential dilution, etc., to determine an approximate value per share to compare to market prices. This latter comparison is the fundamental purpose of the whole process - comparing value (what you get) with price(waht you pay). On this subject he is famous for his viewpoint that "a great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price." Warren Buffett often credits Charlie with convincing him of the wisdom of this approach: "Charlie understood this early. I was a slow learner." Charlie's insight helped Buffett move from pure Benjamin Graham-style investing to focusing on great businesses such as The Washington Post, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Gillette, and others. 

###### By the time he is finished with his analysis, he has reduced the candidate to its most salient elements and achieved a remarkable degree of confidence about whether or not to act. The evaluation finally, becomes not so much mathematical as philosophical. Ultimately "a feel" emerges, a function of both the analysis itself and Charlie's lifetime of accumulated experience and skill in recognizing patterns.

"You are neither right or wrong because the crowd disagrees with you. You are right because your data and reasoning are right." 
-Benjamin Graham 

<br><br>

__"Apply logic to help avoid fooling yourself. Charlie will not accept anything I say just because I say it, although most of the world will."
-Warren Buffett__ 

<br><br>


__"Never fool yourself, and remember that you are the easiest person to fool." 
-Richard P. Feynman__

<br><br>

"I notice that when all a man's information is confined to the field in which he is working, the work is never as good as it ought to be. A man has to get perspective, and he can get it from books or from people-preferably from both." -Harvey Firestone 

<br><br>

__Charlie Sums It Up__ 
"How do some people get wiser than other people? Partly it is inborn temperament. Some people do not have a good temperament for investing. They're too fretful; they worry too much. But if you've got a good temperament, which basically means being very patient, yet combine that with a vast aggression when you know enough to do something, then you just gradually learn the game, partly by doing, partly by studying. Obviously, the more hard lessons you can learn vicariously, instead of from your own terrible experiences, the better off you will be. I don't know anyone who did it with great rapidity. Warren Buffett has become one hell of a lot better investor since the day I met him, and so have I. If we had been frozen at any given stage, with the knowledge hand we had, the record would have been much worse than it is. So the game is to keep learning, and I don't think people are going to keep learning who don't like the learning process." 

<br><br>

__We try more to profit from always remembering the obvious than from grasping the esoteric. It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently nor stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent.__

<br><br>

##### If you take the best text in economics by Mankiw, he says intelligent people make decisions based on opportunity costs-in other words, it's your alternatives that matter.
<br><br>

##### While susceptibility varies, addiction can happen to any of us through a subtle process where the bonds of degradation are too light to be felt until they are too strong to be broken.
<br><br>

##### What I say is that McDonald's is one of our most admirable institutions. Then, as signs of shock come to surrounding faces, I explain that McDonald's, providing first jobs to millions of teenagers, many troubled, over the years, has successfully taught most of them the one lesson they most need: to show up reliably for responsible work. Then I usually go on to say that if the elite campuses were as successful as McDonald's in teaching sensibly, we would have a better world. 

<br><br>

And the great useful model, after compound interest, is the elementary math of permutations and combinations.

<br><br>

At Harvard Business School, the great quantitative thing that bonds the first-year class together is what they call "decision tree theory." All they do is take high school algebra and apply it to real life problems. And the students love it. They're amazed to find that high school algebra works in life.

##### His rule for all the Braun Company's commnunications was called the five W's - you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when, and why. And if you wrote a letter or directive in the Braun Company telling somebody to do something, and you didn't tell him why, you could get fired. In fact, you would get fired if you did it twice. 

##### You might ask why is that so important? Well, again, that's a rule of psychology. Just as you think better if you array knowledge on a bunch of models that are basically answers to the question, why, why, why, if you always tell people why, they'll understand it better, they'll consider it more important, and they'll be more likely to comply. Even if they don't understand your reason, they' ll be more likely to comply.
