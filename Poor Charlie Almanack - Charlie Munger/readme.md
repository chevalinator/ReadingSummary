The quotes below are what represents the essence of the book [Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition](https://www.amazon.ca/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Expanded-Hardcover/dp/1578645018). 

Some quotes have been sligtly modified to complete the meaning since they are sometimes taken out of context.

The emphasis represents the importance of the quote to me.

# Quotes
I think when you're trying to teach great concepts that work, it helps to tie them into the lives an personnalities of the people who developed them. I think you learn economics better if you make Adam Smith your friend. That sounds funny, making friends among 'the eminent dead,' but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life and work better in education. It's way better than just giving the basic concepts.

Charlie has developed an unusual additional attribute-a willingness, even an eagerness, to identify and acknowledge his own mistakes and learn from them. As he once said, "If Bershire has made a modest progress, a good deal of it is because Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year."

Charlie likes the analogy of looking at one's ideas and approaches as "tools." "When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what couJd be better than to swap it for your old, less useful tool? Warren and I routinely do this, but most people, as Galbraith says, forever cling to their old, less useful tools."

__Charlie seek to discover the universe hitched to each of his investment candidates by gaining a firm grasp on all, or at least most, of the relevant factors comprising both its internal and external environment. When properly collected and organized, his Multiple Mental Models (about one hundred in number, he estimates) provide a context or " latticework" that leads to remarkable insights as to the purpose and nature of life. More pertinent to our purpose here, his models supply the analytical structure that enables him to reduce the inherent chaos and confusion of a complex investment problem into a clarified set of fundamentals. *Especially important examples of these models include the redundancy/backup system model from engineering, the compound interest model from mathematics, the breakpoint/tipping-moment/autocatalysis models from physics and chemistry, the modern Darwinian synthesis model from biology and cognitive misjudgment models from psychology.*__

 "Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not. It is the first lesson that ought to be learned and however early a man's training begins, it is probably the last lesson that he learn thoroughly."

__Often, as in this case, Charlie generally focuses first on what to avoid - that is, on what NOT to do - before he considers the affirmative steps he will take in a given situation.__

__"Personaly, I've gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions in various way - which, by and large, are useful - but which often malfunction? One approach is rationnality - the way you'd work out a bridge problem, by evaluating the real interest, the real probabilities, and so forth. And the other is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subcouscious conclusions - many are which are wrong."__

###### "We have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand." To identify potential "yes" candidates, Charlie looks for an easy to understand, dominant business franchise that can sustain itself and thrive in all market environments.

__Identifying Your circle of Competence__  
In Talk Nine (page 400), Charlie tells the apocryphal story of Max Planck and the chauffeur who drove him to the public lecture he gave throughout Germany. On one occasion the chauffeur, who by this time knew the lecture by heart, suggested that he and Planck switch places. At the conclusion of the chauffeur's flawless recitation of the lecture, a physicist stood up and posed a very difficult question. The chauffeur, ready for the situation, replied, "I'm surprised that a citizen of an advanced city like Munich is asking so elementary a question, so I'm going to ask my chauffeur ro respond." 
  
In the real world, it is critical to distinguish when you are "Max Planck," and when you are the "chauffeur." If you cannot respond legitimately to the *next* question, you lack true masrery and are likely outside your "Circle of Competence."

<br><br>

###### Munger and Buffer are laser-focused on this issue: Over their long business careers they have learned, sometimes painfully, that few businesses survive over multiple gnenerations.

---
<br><br>

###### Charlie seeks to calculate the intrinsic value of the whole business and, with allowance for potential dilution, etc., to determine an approximate value per share to compare to market prices. This latter comparison is the fundamental purpose of the whole process - comparing value (what you get) with price(waht you pay). On this subject he is famous for his viewpoint that "a great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price." Warren Buffett often credits Charlie with convincing him of the wisdom of this approach: "Charlie understood this early. I was a slow learner." Charlie's insight helped Buffett move from pure Benjamin Graham-style investing to focusing on great businesses such as The Washington Post, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Gillette, and others. 

---
###### By the time he is finished with his analysis, he has reduced the candidate to its most salient elements and achieved a remarkable degree of confidence about whether or not to act. The evaluation finally, becomes not so much mathematical as philosophical. Ultimately "a feel" emerges, a function of both the analysis itself and Charlie's lifetime of accumulated experience and skill in recognizing patterns.

"I notice that when all a man's information is confined to the field in which he is working, the work is never as good as it ought to be. A man has to get perspective, and he can get it from books or from people-preferably from both." -Harvey Firestone

__Charlie Sums It Up__ 
"How do some people get wiser than other people? Partly it is inborn temperament. Some people do not have a good temperament for investing. They're too fretful; they worry too much. But if you've got a good temperament, which basically means being very patient, yet combine that with a vast aggression when you know enough to do something, then you just gradually learn the game, partly by doing, partly by studying. Obviously, the more hard lessons you can learn vicariously, instead of from your own terrible experiences, the better off you will be. I don't know anyone who did it with great rapidity. Warren Buffett has become one hell of a lot better investor since the day I met him, and so have I. If we had been frozen at any given stage, with the knowledge hand we had, the record would have been much worse than it is. So the game is to keep learning, and I don't think people are going to keep learning who don't like the learning process."

###### What I say is that McDonald's is one of our most admirable institutions. Then, as signs of shock come to surrounding faces, I explain that McDonald's, providing first jobs to millions of teenagers, many troubled, over the years, has successfully taught most of them the one lesson they most need: to show up reliably for responsible work. Then I usually go on to say that if the elite campuses were as successful as McDonald's in teaching sensibly, we would have a better world.

At Harvard Business School, the great quantitative thing that bonds the first-year class together is what they call "decision tree theory." All they do is take high school algebra and apply it to real life problems. And the students love it. They're amazed to find that high school algebra works in life.

###### His rule for all the Braun Company's commnunications was called the five W's - you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when, and why. And if you wrote a letter or directive in the Braun Company telling somebody to do something, and you didn't tell him why, you could get fired. In fact, you would get fired if you did it twice. 

---
<br><br>
###### You might ask why is that so important? Well, again, that's a rule of psychology. Just as you think better if you array knowledge on a bunch of models that are basically answers to the question, why, why, why, if you always tell people why, they'll understand it better, they'll consider it more important, and they'll be more likely to comply. Even if they don't understand your reason, they' ll be more likely to comply.

###### The perceptual apparatus of man has shortcuts in it. The brain cannot have unlimited circuitry. So someone who knows how to take advantage of those shortcuts and cause the brain to miscalculate in cercain ways can cause you to see things that aren't there.

The elementary part of psychology-the psychology of misjudgment, as I call it-is a terribly important thing to learn.

###### Change, as in the case of the Internet, can be the friend of society. But it is the absence of change that is often the friend of the investor. While the Internet will change many things, it will not likely change the brand of gum people chew. Charlie and I like stable businesses like chewing gum and try to leave life's more unpredictable things to someone else." -Buffett

###### And in a bureaucracy, you think the work is done when it goes out of your in-basket into somebody else's in-basket. But, of course, it isn't. It is  not done until AT&T delivers what it's supposed to deliver. So you get big, fat, dumb, unmotivated bureaucracies. 

---
<br><br>
###### They also tend to become somewhat corrupt. In other words, if I've got a department and you've got a department and we kind of share power running this thing, there's sort of an unwritten rule: "If you won't bother me, I won't bother you, and we're both happy" So you ger layers of management and associated costs that nobody needs. Then, while people are justifying all these layers, it takes forever to get anything done. They're too slow to make decisions, and nimbler people run circles around them.

<br><br>

If people tell you what you really don't want to hear - what's unpleasant- there's an almost automatic reaction of antipathy. You have to train yourself out of it. It isn't foredestined that you have to be this way. But you will tend to be this way if you don't think about it.

So life is an everlasting battle between those two forces - to get those advantages of scale on one side and a tendency to get a lot like the U.S. Agriculture Departmemt on the other side- where they just sit around and so forth.

###### Here's a model that we've had trouble with. Maybe you'll be able co figure it out better. Many markets get down to two or three big competitors- or five or six. And in some of those markets, nobody makes any money to speak of. But in others, everybody does very well.

<br><br>
###### The great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when technology is going to help you and when it's going to kill you. And most peopk do not get this straight in their heads. But a fellow like Buffett does. 

###### For example, when we were in the textile business, which is a terrible commodity business, we were making low-end textiles- which are a real commodity product. And one day, the people came to Warren and said, "They've invented a new loom that we think will do twice as nwch work as our old ones." And Warren said, "Gee, I hope th is doesn't work-because if it does, l'm going to close the mill." And he meant it. What was he thinking? He was thinking, "It's a lousy business. we are earning substandard returns and keeping it open just to be nice to the elderly workers. But we're not going to put huge amounts of new capital into a lousy business." 

###### And he knew that the huge productivity increases that would come from a better machine introduced into the production of a commodity product will all go to the benefit of the buyers of the textiles. Nothing was going to stick to our ribs as owners. [...]. The cost reduction came through all right. But the benefit of the cost reductions didn't go to the guy who bought the equipment. It's such a simple idea, It's so basic. And yet it's so often forgotten.

So you have to figure out what your own aptitude's are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don't, you're going to lose. And that's as close as certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you've got an edge. And you've got to play within your own circle of competence.

 If you want to be the best tennis player in the world, vou may start out trying and soon find out that it's hopeless- that other people blow right by you. However, if you want to become the best plumbing contractor in Bemidji, that is probably doable by two-thirds of you. It takes a will. It takes the intelligence. But after a while, you'd gradually know all about the plumbing business in Bemidji and master the art. That is an attainable objective, given enough discipline.And people who could never win a chess tournament or stand in center court in a respectable tennis tournament can rise quite high in life by slowly developing a circle of competence- which results partly from what they were born with and partly from what they slowly develop through work.

###### The model I like - to sort of simplify the notion of what goes on in a market for common stock - is the pari-mutuel system at the race track. If you stop to think about it, a pari-mutuel system is a market.  Everybody goes there and bets, and the odds change based on what's bet. That's what happen in the common stock market

<br><br>
###### How many insisghts  do you need? Well, I'd argue that you don't need many in a lifetime. If you look at Berkshire Hathaway and all of its accumulated billions, the top ten insights account for most of it.

---
<br><br>
###### So you can get very remarkable investment results if you think more like a winning pari-mutuel player. Just think of it as a hevy  odds against game full of bullshit and crazyness with an occasional mispriced something or other. And vou're probably nor going to be smart enough to find thousands in a lifetime. And when you get a few, you really load up. It's just that simple.

<br><br>
I think the reason whv we got into such idiocy in investment management is best illustrated by a story that I tell about the guy who sold fishing tackle. I asked him, "My God, they're purple and green. Do fish really take these lures?" And he said, "Mister, I don't sell to fish." 

---
<br><br>
As usual in human affairs, what determines the behavior are incentives for the decision maker, and "getting the incentives right" is a very, very important lesson. 

---
<br><br>
###### All right, we've now recognized that the market is efficient as a pari-mutuel system is efficient-with the favorite more likely than the long shot to do well in racing, but not necessarily given any betting advantage to those that bet on the favorite. 

###### In the stock market. some railroad that beset by better competitors and rough union may be available at one-third of its book value. In contrast. IBM in its heyday might be selling at six times book value. So it's just like the pari-mutuel system. Any damn fool could plainly see that IBM had better business prospects than the railroad. But once you put the price into the formula, it wasn't so clear anymore what was going to work best for a buyer choosing between the stocks. So it's a lot like a pari-mutuel system. And, therefore, it gets very hard to beat. 

---
<br><br>

###### the best part of it all was his concept of "Mr. Market." Instead of thinking the market was efficient, Graham treated it as a maniac-depressive who comes by every day. And some day "Mr. Market" says, "I'll sell you some of my interest for way less than you think it os worth." And other d;tys. he comes by and says, "I'll buy your interest ar a price that's way higher than you think it's worth." And you get the option of deciding whether you want to buy more, sell part of what you already have, or do nothing at all. 

---
<br><br>
##### Over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns six percent on capital over forty vears and you hold it for that forty years, you're not going to make much different than a six percent return-even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns eighteen percent on capital over twenty or thirty years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you'll end up with one hell of a result. 

---
<br><br>
##### However, averaged out, betting on the quality of a business is better than betting on the quality of management. In other words, if you have to choose one, bet on the business momentum, not the brillance of the manager.

__What overall life advice do you have for youg people?__
Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step-by-step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day-by-day, and at the end of the day-if you live long enough-like most people, you will get out of life what you deserve.

Above all, live with change and adapt to it.

<br><br>
__As I said at the U.S.C Business School, what you need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And you hang your actual experience and your vicarious experience (that you get from reading and so forth) on this latticework of powerful models. And with that system, things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.__

__You don't have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines. And it's not that hard to do.__ 

---
<br><br>
Similarly, I've told you to think forward and backward. Well, great declarers in bridge think, "How can I take the necessary winners?" But they think it through backwards, [ too. They also think, ] "What could possibly go wrong that could cause me to have too many losers? And both methods of thinking are useful. So [to win in] the game of life, get the needed models into your head and think it through forward and backward. What works in bridge will work in life.

And it's kind of fun to sit there and outthink people who are way smarter than you are because you've trained yourself to be more objective and multidisciplinary...

__Of all the models that people ought to have in useful form and don't, perhaps the most important lie in the area of psychology....__

<br><br>
Heavy ideology is one of the most extreme distorters of human cognition. Look at there Islamic fundamentalists who just gunned down a bunch of Greek tourists shouring, "God's work!" 

Ideology does some strange things and distorts cognition terribly. If you get a lot of heavy ideology young-and then you start expression it-you are really locking your brain into a very unfortunate pattern. And you are going to distort your general cognition. 
<br><br>
You can have heavy ideology in favor of accuracy, diligence, and objectivity. But a heavy ideology that makes you absolutely sure that the minimum wage should be raised or that it shouldn't-and it's kind of a holy construct where you know you're right-makes you a bit nuts. 

---
<br><br>
Well, I have far less in the way of qualifications than Pinker. In fact, I've never taken a single course in psychology. However, I've 
come to exactly the same conclusion-that the psychology texts, while thev are wonderful in pat, are also significantly daft. 

About three centuries before the birth of Christ, Demosthenes said, "What a man wishes, that also will he believe." Well, Demosrhencs 
was right.

<br><br>
Psychology to me, as currently organized, is like electromagnetism after Faraday but before Maxwell-a lot has been discovered, but no one mind has put it all together in proper form. And it should be done because it wouldn't be that hard to do-and it's enormously important.

<br><br>
"The live essential entrepreneurial skills for success are concentration, discrimination, organization, innovation, and conununication."
-Michael Faraday

<br><br>
How can smart people be so wrong? Well, the answer is that they don't do what I'm telling you to do-which is to take all the main models from psychology and use them as a checklist in reviewing outcomes in complex systems.

---
<br><br>
__So you have to go back and put in your own head what I'd call the psychology of misjudgment in a form whereby you have all of the important models and you can use them.__ 

__There's only one right way to do it: You have to get the main doctrines together and use them as a checklist. And, to repeat for emphasis, you have to pay special attention to combinational effects that create lollapalooza consequences.__


---
<br><br>

__For example, take the issue of stealing. A very significant fraction of the people in the world will steal if (A) it's very easy to do and (B) there's practically no chance of being caught.__

__And once they start stealling, the consistency principle-which is a big part of human psychology-will soon combine with operant conditioning to make stealing habitual. So if you run a business where it's easy to steal because of your methods, you're working a great moral injury on rhe people who work for you.__

__Again, that's obvious. It's very, very important to create human systems that are hard to cheat. Otherwise, you're ruining your civilization because these big incentives will create incentive-caused bias and people will rationalize that bad behavior is OK.__ 

__Then, if somebody else does it, now you've got at least two psychological principles: incentive-caused bias plus social proof. Not only that, but you get Serpico effects: If enough people are profiting in a general social climate of doing wrong, then they' ll turn on you and become dangerous enem ies if you try and blow the whistle.__

<br><br>

Take the workers' compensation system in California. Stress is real. And its misery can be real. So you want to compensate people for their stress in the workplace. It seems like a noble thing to do. 

But the trouble with such a compensation practice is that it's practically impossible to delete huge cheating. And once you reward  cheating, you get crooked lawyers, crooked doctors, crooked unions, etc .. participating in referral schemes. You get a total miasma of disastrous behavior. And the behavior makes all the people doing it worse as they do it. So you were trying to help your civilization. But what you did was create enormous damage, net. 

So it's much better to let some things go uncompensated-to let life be hard-than to create systems that are easy to cheat.

##### What makes investment hard, as I said at U.S. C., is that it's easy to see that some companies have better businesses than others. But the price of the stock goes up so high that, all of a sudden, the question of which sto ~ck is the best to buy gets quite difficult.

#### As Buffett and I say over and over again, we don't leap seven-foor fences. Instead, we look for one-foot fences with big rewards on the other side. So we've succeeded by making the world easy for ourselves, not by solving hard problems.

<br><br>

#### And yes - a low-tech business can be plenty hard. Just try to open a restaurant and make it succeed.

__You must have the confidence to override people with more credentials than you whose cognition is impaired by incentive-caused bias or some similar psychological force that is obviously present.

__On using psychological techniques on people__  
And if you see he wants to do something really srupid, it probably won't work to tell him, "What you're doing is bad. I have better morals than you." 

That offend's him. You're young. He's old. Therefore, instead of being persuaded, he's more likely to react with, "Who in the hell are you to establish the moral code of the whole world?" 

But, instead, you can say to him. "You can't do that without three other people beneath you knowing about it. Therefore, you're making yourself subject to blackmail. You're risking your reputation. You're risking your family, your money, etc." 

That is likely to work. And you're telling him something that's true. Do you want to spend a lot of time working for people where you have to use methods like that to get them to behave well? I think the answer is no. But if you're hooked with it, appealing to his interest is likely to work better as a matter of human persuasion than appealing to anything else. That. again. is a powerful psychological principle with deep biological roots.

<br><br>
__On notions helpful in solving problems__  
The first helpful notion is that it is usually best to simplify problems by deciding big "no-brainer" questions first. 

The second helpful notion mimics Galileo's conclusion that scientific reality is often revealed only by math as if math was the language of God. Galileo's attitude also works well in messy, practical life. Without numerical fluency, in the part of life most of us inhabit, you are like a one-legged man in an ass-kicking contest. 

The third helpful notion is that it is not enough to think problems through forward. You must also think in reverse, much like the rustic who wanted to know where he was going to die so that he'd never go there. Indeed, many problems can't be solved forward. And that is why the great algebraist Carl Jacobi so often said, "Invert, always invert." And why the Pythagoreans thought in reverse to prove that the square root of two was an irrational number.

The fourth helpful notion is that the best and most practical wisdom is elementary academic wisdom. But there is one extremely important qualification: You must think in a multidisciplinary manner. You must routinely use all those easy-to-learn concepts from the freshman course in every basic subject. Where elementary ideas will serve, your problem solving must not be limited, as academia and many business bureaucracies are limited, by extreme balkanization into disciplines and subdisciplines, with strong taboos against any venture outside assigned territory.[...]

If, in your thinking, you rely entirely on others, often through purchase of professional advice, whenever outside a small territory of your own, you will suffer much calamity. And it is not just difficulties in complex coordination that will do you in. You will also suffer from the reality evoked by the Shavian character who said, "In the last analysis, every profession is a conspiracy against the laity." Indeed, a Shavian character, for once, understated the horrors of something Shaw didn't like. It is not usually the conscious malfeasance of your narrow professional adviser that does you in. Instead. your troubles, come from his subconscious bias. His cognition will often be impaired. for your purposes. by financial incentives different from yours. And he will also suffer from the psychological defect caught by thta proverb: "To a man with a hammer, every problern looks like a nail." 

The fifth helpful notion is that really big effects, lollapalooza effects, will often come only from large combinations; of factors. For instance, tuberculosis was tamed, at least for a long time, only by routine, combined use in each case of three different drugs. And other lollapalooza effects. like the flight of an airplane, follow a similar pattern.

Benjamin Franklin's observation in Poor Richard's Almanach, "If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason." 

---
<br><br>
I absorbed what I call the fundamental full attribution ethos of hard science. And that was enormously useful to me. Let me explain that ethos. 

Under this ethos, you've got to know all the big ideas in all the disciplines more fundamental than your own. You can never make any explanation that can be made in a more fundamental way in any other way than the most fundamental way. And you always take with full attribution to the most fundamental ideas that you are required to use. When you're using physics, you say you're using physics. When you're using biology, you say you're using biology. And so on and so on. I could early see that that ethos would act as a fine organizing system for my thought. And I strongly suspected that it would work really well in the soft sciences as well as the hard sciences, so I just grabbed it and used it all through my life in soft science as wdell as hard science. That was a very lucky idea for me.

Two hundred years ago, aided by the growth of technology and the growth of other developments in the civilitation, the real output per capita of the civilized world started going up at about two percent per annum, compounded. And before that, for the previous thousands of years, it had gone up at a rate that hovered just a hair's-breadth above zero.

What's Wrong with Economics? 

1) Fatal Unconnectedness, Leading to man-with-a-hammcr Syndrome, Often Causing Overweighing What Can Be Counted


---
<br><br>
__Thenature of this failure is that it creates what I always call man-with-a-hammer syndrome. And that's taken from the folk saying: To the man with only a hammer,every problem looks pretty much like a nail. And that works marvelously to gum up all professions and all departments of academia and, indeed, most practical life.The only antidote for being an absolute klutz due to the presence of a man-with-a-hammer syndrome is to have a full kit of tools. You don't have just a hammer.You've got all the tools. And you've got to have one more trick. You've got to use those tools checklist-style because you'l l miss a lot if you just hope that the right tool is going to pop up unaided whenever you need it. But if you've got a full list of tools and go through them in your mind, checklist-style, you will find a lot of answers that you won't find any other way.__

A special version of this man-with-a-hammer syndrome is terrible, not only in economics but practically everywhere else, including business. lt's really terrible in business. You've got a complex system, and it spews out a lot of wonderful numbers that enable you to measure some factors. But there are other factors that are terribly
important, [yet] there's no precise numbering you can put to these factors. You know they're important, but you don't have the numbers. Well, practically everybody (1) overweighs the stuff that can be numbered because it yields to the statistical techniques they're taught in academia and (2) doesn't mix in the hard-to-measure stuff that may be more important. That is a mistake I've tried all my life to avoid, and I have no regrets for having done that.

I want economics to pick up the basic ethos of hard science, the full attribution habit, but not that craving for an unattainable precision that comes from physics envy. The sort of precise, reliable formula that includes Boltzmann's constant is not going to happen, by and large, in economics. Economics involves too complex a system. And the craving for that physic-style precision does little but get you in terrible trouble,

__On explaining how to explains a business success__

Wel, how did I solve those problems? Obviously, I was using a simple search engine in my mind to go through checklist-style, and I was using some rough algorithms that work pretty well in a great many complex systems, and those algorithms run something like this: Extreme success is likely to be caused by some combination of the following factors: 

A) Extreme maximization or minimization of one or two variables. Example, Costco or our furniture and appliance store. 

B) Adding success factors so that a bigger combination drives success, often in nonlinear fashion, as one is reminded by the concept of breakpoint and the concept of critical mass in physics. Often results are not linear. You get a little bit more mass, and you get a lollapalooza result. And, of course, l've been searching for lollapalooza results all my life, so I'm very interested in models that explain their occurrence. 

C) An extreme of good performance over many factors. Example, Toyota or Les Schwab. 

D) Catching and riding some sort of big wave. Example, Oracle.

Why did Max Planck, one of the smartest people who ever lived, give up economics? The answer is, he said, "It's too hard. The best solution you can get is messy and uncertain."

<br><br>
all human systems are gamed, for reasons rooted deeply in psychology, and great skill is displayed in the gaming because game theory has so much potential. That's what's wrong with the workers' comp system in California. Gaming has been raised to an art form. In the course of gaming the system, people learn to be crooked. Is this good for civilization? Is it good for economic perfonnance? Hell, no. The people who design easily gameable systems belong in the lowest circle of hell. 

---
<br><br>
__About People designing easily gameable system__
They just don't think about what terrible things they're doing to the civilization because they don't take into account the second-order effects and the third-order effects in lying and cheating.

---
<br><br>
__On Tolerating unfrainess for the greater good__
It is not always recognized that, to function best, morality should sometimes appear unfair, like most worldly outcomes. The craving for perfect fairness causes a lot of terrible problems in system function. Some systems should be made deliberately unfair to individuals because they'll be fairer on average for all of us. Thus, there can be virtue in apparent non-fairness. I frequently cite the example of having your career over, in the Navy. if your ship goes aground, even if it wasn't your fault. I says the lack of justice for the one guy that wasn't at fault is way more than made up by a greater justice for everybody when every captain of a ship always sweats blood to make sure the ship doesn't go aground.

__"A mean who doesn't know what happened before he is born goes through life like a child"
-Marcus Tulius Cicero__

---
<br><br>
__On Inversion__
The way complex adaptive systems work, and the way mental constructs work, problems frequently get easier to solve through "inversion. " If you turn problems around into reverse, you often think better. 

For instance, if you want to help India, the question you should consider asking is not: "How can I help India?" instead, you should ask: "How can I hurt India?" You find what will do the worst damage, and then try to avoid it. Perhaps the two approaches seem logically the same thing. But those who have mastered algebra know that inversion will often and easily solve problems chat otherwise resist solution. And in life, just as in algebra, inversion will help you solve problems that you can't otherwise handle. 

---
<br><br>
__On Extreme Ideology__
Another thing to avoid is extremely intense ideology because it cabbages up one's mind. You see a lot of it in the worst of the TV preachers. They have different, intense, inconsistent ideas about technical theology, and a lot of them have minds reduced to cabbage. (Audience laughs) And that can happen with political ideology. And if you're young, it's particularly easy to drift into intense and foolish political ideology and never get out. 

---
<br><br>
__On what's needed to hold an opinion__
I have what I call an "iron prescription" that helps me keep sane when I drift toward preferring one intense ideology over another. I feel that I'm not entitled to have an opinion unless I can ttate the arguments against my position better than the people who are in opposition. 1 think that I am qualified to speak only when I've reached that state. 



---
<br><br>
__About self-pity__
Every time vou find you're drifting into self-pity, whatever the cause, even if your child is dying of cancer, self-pity is not going help. Just give yourself one of my friend's cards. Self-pity is always counterproductive. It's the wrong way to think. And when you avoid it, you get a great advantage over everybody else, or almost everybody else, because self-pity is a standard response. And you can train yourself out of it. 

---
<br><br>
__Self-serving bias__
Another thing that often causes folly and ruin is the "self-serving bias," often subconscious, to which we're all subject. You think that "the true little me" is entitled to do what it wants to do. For instance, why shouldn't the true little me get what it wants by overspending its income?

Of course you also want to get self-serving bias out of your mental routines. Thinking that what's good for you is good for the wider civilization, and rationalizing foolish or evil conduct, based on your subconscious tendency to serve yourself, is a terrible way to think. And you want to drive that out of yourself because you want to be wise not foolish, and good not evil. You also have to allow, in your own cognition and conduct, for the self-serving bias of everybody else, because most people are not going to be very successful at removing such bias, the human condition being what it is. If you don't allow for self-serving bias in the conduct of others, you are, again, a fool.

---
<br><br>
__On finding counterhypothesis__
Engaging in routines that allow you to maintain objectivity are, of course, very helpful to cognition. We all remember that Darwin paid special attention to disconfirming evidence, particularly when it disconfirmed something he believed and loved. Routines like that are required if a life is to maximize correct thinking. And one also needs check list routines. They prevent a lot of errors, and not just for pilots. You should nor only possess wide-ranging elementary wisdom but also go through mental checklist routines in using it. There is no other procedure that will work as well. 

---
<br><br>
__Non-equality__
Another idea that I found important is that maximizing non-egality will often work wonders. 
[...]
I think the game of competitive life often requires maximizing the experience of the people who have the most aptitude and the most determination as learning machines. And if you want the very highest reaches of human acheivement, that's where you have to go.

---
<br><br>
__Intense interest__
Another thing that I have found is that intense interest in any subject is indispensable if you're really going to excel in it. I could force myself to be fairly good in a lot of things, but I couldn't excel in anything in which I didn't have an intense interest. So to some extent you're going to have to do as I did. If at all feasible, you want to maneuver yourself into doing something in which you have an intense nterest. 

---
<br><br>
__On how to deal with bad things in life__
Another thing to cope with is that life is very likely to provide terrible blows, unfair blows. Some people recover. and others don't. And there I think the attitute of Epictetus helps guide one to the right reaction. He thought that mischance in life, however bad, reated an opportunity to behave well. He believed every mischance provided an opportunity to learn something useful. And one's duty was not to become immersed in self-pity, but to utilize each terrible blow in a constructible fashion. 

---

__On an alternative to bureaucraty__
The last idea that I want to give to you, as you go out into a profession that fequently puts a lot of procedure and some mumbo jumbo into what it does, is that complex bureaucratic procedure does not represent the highest form of civilization can reach. One higher form is a seamless, non-bureaucratic web of deserved trust. Not much fancy procedure, just totally reliable people correctly trusting one another.

<br><br>
__On contrast Bias__
A magician demonstrates this sort of contrast-based error in your nervous system when he remove your wristwatch without your feeling it. As he does this, he applies pressure of touch on your wrist that you would sense if it was the only pressure of touch you were experiencing. But he has concurrently applied other intense pressure of touch on your body, but not on your wrist, "swamping" the wrist pressure by creating a high-contrast touch pressure elsewhere. This high contrast takes the wrist pressure below perception.

---
<br><br>
__On Contrast Bias__
__Some psychology professors like to demonstrate the inadequacy of contrast-based perception by having students put one hand in a bucket of hot water and one hand in a bucket of cold water. They are then suddenly asked to remove both hands and place them in a single bucket of room-temperature water. Now, with both hands in thesame water, one hand feels as if it has just been put in cold water and the other hand feels as if it has just been placed in hot water. When one thus sees perception so easily fooled by mere contrast, where a simple temperature gauge would make no error, and realizes that cognition mimics perception in being misled by mere contrast, he is well on the way toward understanding, not only how magicians fool one, but also how life will fool one.__

<br><br>
Man's- often wrong but generally useful psychological tendencies are quite numerous and quite different. The natural consequence of this profusion of tendencies is the grand general principle of social psychology: cognition is ordinarily situation-dependent so that different situations often cause different conclusions, even when the same person is thinking in the same general subject area.

__Reward and Punishment Superresponse tendency__
Early in the history of Xerox, Joe Wilson, who was then in the government, had a similar experience. He had to go back to Xerox because he couldn't understand why its new machine was selling so poorly in relation to its older and inferior machine. When he got back to Xerox, he found out that the commission arrangement with the salesmen gave a large and perverse incentive to push the inferior machine on customers, who deserved a better result.

We should also heed the general lesson implicit in the injuction of Ben Franklin in Poor Richard's Almanack: "If you would persuade, appeal to interest and not to reason." This maxim is a wise guide to a great and simple precaution in life: Never, ever, think about something else when you should be thinking about the power of incentives.

We should also remember how a foolish and willful ignorance of the superpower of rewards caused Soviet communists to get their final result as described by one employee: "They pretend to pay us and we pretend to work." __Perhaps the most important rule in management is, "Get the incentives right."__

He demonstrated again and again a great recurring, generalized behavioral algorithm in nature: '"Repeat behavior that works." He also demonstrated that prompt rewards worked much better than delayed reward's in changing and maintaining behavior. And, once his rats and pigeons had conditioned reflexes, caused by food rewards, he found what withdrawal pattern of rewards kept the reflexive behavior longest in place: random distribution.

Later, Skinner lost most of his personal reputation (a) by overclaiming for incentive superpower to the point of thinking he could create a human utopia with it and (b) by displaying hardly any recognition of the power of the rest of psychology. He thus behaved like one of Jacob Viner's truffle hounds as he tried to explain everything with incentive effects.

__Man-with-a-hammer tendency does not exempt smart people like Blanchard and Skinner. And it won't exempt you if you don't watch out.__ 

__One of the most important consequences of incentive superpower is what I call "incentive-caused bias." A man has an acculturated nature making him a pretty decent fellow, and yet, driven both consciously and subconsciously by incentives, he drifts into immoral behavior in order to get what he wants, a result he facilitates by rationalizing his bad behavior, like the salesmen at Xerox who harmed customers in order to maximize their sales comissions.__ 

__Widespread incentive-caused bias requires that one should often distrust, or take with a grain of salt, the advice of one's professional advisor, even if he is an engineer. The general antidotes here are: (1) especially fear professional advice when it is especially good for the advisor; (2) learn and use the basic elements of your advisor's trade as you deal with your advisor; and (3) double check, disbelieve, or replace much of what you're told, to the degree that seems appropriate after objective thought.__
<br><br>

One implication is that people who create things like cash registers,which make dishonest behavior hard to accomplish, are some of the effective saints of our civilization because, as Skinner so well knew, bad behavior is intensely habit-forming when it is rewarded. And so the cash register was a great moral instrument when it was created.

As the name implies, the economists have typically known that, just as grain is always lost to rats, employers always lose to employees who improperly think of themselves first. Employer-installed antidotes include tough internal audit systems and severe public punishment for identified miscreants, as well as misbehavior-preventing routines and such machines as cash registers. From the employee's point of view, incentive-caused bias quite naturally cause opposing abuse from the employer: the sweatshop, the unsafe work place, etc. And thse bad results for employees have antidotes not only in pressure fomr unions but also in government action, such as wage and hour laws[...].

---
<br><br>
The extreme success of free-market capitalism as an economic system owes much to its prevention of many of bad effects from incentive-caused bias. Most capitalist owner [...] live on the difference between their competitive prices and their overall cost and their business will perish if cost exceed sales. Replace such owners by salaried employees of the state and you will normally get a substantial reduction in overall efficency as each employee who replaces an owner is subject to incentive-caused bias as he determines what service he will give in exchange for his salary.

---
<br><br>
 Another  generalized consequence of incentive-caused bias is that man tends to "game" all human systems, often displaying great ingenuity in wrongly serving himself at the expense of others. Anti-gaming features, therefore, constitute a huge and necessary part of almost all system design. Also neede in system design is admonition: Dread, and avoid as much you can, rewarding people for waht can easily be faked.

---
<br><br>
__Granny's Rule__<br>
consultatn Ph. D. psychologists often urge business organizations to improve their reward systems by teaching executives to use "Granny's Rule" to govern their own daily behavior.  Granny's Rule, to be specific, is the requirement that children eat their carrots before they get dessert. And the business version requires tht executives force themselves daily to first do their unpleasant and necessary task before rewarding themselves to their pleasan tasks. Given reward superpower, this practice is wise and sound.

---
<br><br>
__Like Tendency__<br>
One very practical consequence of Liking/Loving Tendency is that it acts as a conditioning device that makes the liker or lover tend (1) to ignore faults of, and comply with wishes of, the object of his affection, (2) to favor people, products, and actions merely associated with the object of his affection, and (3) to distort other facts to facilitate love.

---
<br><br>
__Dislike Tendency__<br>
Disliking tendency also acts as a conditioning device that makes the disliker/hater tend to (1) ignore virtues in the object of dislike (2) dislike people, products, and actions merely associated with the subject of dislike, and (3) distort other facts to facilitate hatred.

Buffett has repeatedly explained to me that "a major difference between rich and poor people is that the rich people can spend their lives suing their relatives." 

---
<br><br>
__Doubt-Avoidance Tendency__<br>
The brain of man is programmed with a tendency to quickly remove doubt by reaching some decision.
[...] what usually triggers Doubt-Avoidance Tendency is some combinaison of (1) puzzlement and (2) stress.

---
<br><br>
__Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency__<br>
The brain of man conserves programming space by being reluctant to changes, which is a form of inconsistency avoidance. We see this in all human habits, constructive and destructive.[...] practically everyone has a great many bad habits he has long maintained despite their being known as bad. Given this situation, it is not too much in many case to appraise early-formed habits as destiny. When Marleys's miserable ghosts says, "I wear the chains I forged in life," he is talking about chains of habit that were too light to be felt before they became too strong to be broken. 

---
<br><br>
__Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency__<br>
It is easy to see that a quickly reached conclusion, triggered by Doubt-avoidance Tendency, when combined with a tendency to resist any change in that conclusion, will naturally cause a lot of errors in cognition for modern man. And so it observably works out. We all deal much with other's whom we correctly diagnose as imprisoned in poor conclusions that are maintained by mental habits they formed early and will carry to their graves.

<br><br>
__Inconsistency-Avoidance Tendency__<br>
What Keynes was reporting is that the human mind works a lot like the human egg. When one sperm gets into a human egg, there's an automatic shut-off device that bars any other sperm from getting in.

<br><br>

As he was rising from obscurity in Philadelphia and wanted the approval of some important man, Franklin would often maneuver that man into doing Franklin some unimportant favor, like lending Franklin a book. Thereafter, the man would admire and trust Franklin more because a nonadmired and nontrusted Franklin would be inconsistent with the appraisal implicit in lending Franklin the book. 

---
<br><br>
When one is maneuvered into deliberately hurting some other person, one will tend to disapprove or even hate that person.

---
<br><br>
__Kantian Fairness Tendency__<br>
Also, strangers often voluntarily share equally in unexpected, unearned good and bad fortune. And, as an observe consequence of such "fair-sharing" conduct, much reactive hostility occurs when fair-sharking is expected yet not provided.

---
<br><br>
__Reciprocation Tendency__<br>
Like other psychological tendencies, and also man's ability to turn somersaults, reciprocate-favor tendency operates to a very considerable degree at a subconscious level. This helps make the tendency a strong force that can sometimes be used by some men to mislead others, which happens all the time. For instance, when an automobile salesman graciously steers you into a comfortable place to sit and gives you a cup of coffee, you are very likely being tricked, by this small courtesy alone, into parting with an extra five hundred dollars.

However, in this scenario of buying a car, you are going to be disadvantaged by parting with an extra five hundred dollars of your own money. This potential loss will protect you to some extent. But suppose you are the purchasing agent of someone else-a rich employer, for instance. Now the minor favor you receive from the salesman is less opposed by the threat of extra cost to you because someone else is paying the extra cost. Under such circumstances, the salesman is often able to maximize his advantage, particularly when government is the purchaser. 

---
<br><br>
To the extent the feeling of guilt has an evolutionary base, I believe the most plausible cause is the mental conflict triggered in one direction by reciprocate-favor tendency and in the opposite direction by reward superresponse tendency pushing one to enjoy one hundred percent of some good thing.[...]There is a charming Irish Catholic priest in my neighborhood who, with rough accuracy, often says, "The old Jews may have invented guilt, but we Catholics perfected it." And if you, like me and this priest, believe that, averaged out, feelings of guilt do more good than harm, you may join in my special gratitude for reciprocate-favor tendency, no matter how unpleasant you find feelings of guilt.

<br><br>
__Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency__<br>
Enven association that appears to be trivial, if carefully planned, can have extreme and peculiar effects on purchasers of products. The target purchaser of shoe polish may like pretty girls. And so he chooses the polish with the pretty girl on the can or the one with the pretty girl in the last ad for shoe polish that he saw.

---
<br><br>
__Influence-from-Mere-Association Tendency__<br>
The proper antidotes to being made such a patsy by past success are (1) to carefully examine each past success, looking for accidental, non-causative factors associated with such success that will tend to mislead as one appraises odds implicit in a proposed new undertaking and (2) to look for dangerous aspects of the new undertaking that were not present when past success occurred. 

---
<br><br>
Hating and disliking also cause miscalculation triggered by mere association. ln business, I commonly see people under appraise both the competency and morals of competitors they dislike.This is a dangerous practice, usually disguised because it occurs on a subconscious basis.

---
<br><br>
__Persian Messenger Syndrome__<br>
Persian Messenger Syndrome is alive and well in modern life, albeit in less lethal versions.It is actually dangerous in many careers to be a carrier of unwelcome news. Union negotiators and employer representatives often know this,and it leads to many tragedies in labor relations. Sometimes lawyers, knowing their clients will hate them if they recommend an unwelcome but wise settlement, will carry on to disaster. 

---
<br><br>
__Persian Messenger Syndrome__<br>
The proper antidote to creating Persian Messenger Syndrome and its bad effects, like those at CBS, is to develop, through exercise of will, a habit of welcoming bad news. At Berkshire, there is a common injunction: "Always tell us the bad news promptly. It is only the good news chat can wait." It also helps to be so wise and informed that people fear not telling you bad news because you are so likely to get it elsewhere.

---
<br><br>
__Hurting people helping you__<br>
Influence-from -mere-Association Tendency often has a shocking effect that helps swamp the normal tendency to return favor for favor. Sometimes, when one receives a favor, his condition is unpleasant, due to poverty, sickness, subjugation, or something else. In addition the favor may trigger an envy-driven dislike for the person who was in so favorable a state that he could easily be a favor giver. Under such circumstances, the favor receiver, prompted partly by mere association of the favor giver with past pain, will not only dislike the man who helped him but also try to injure him. 

---
<br><br>
__Excessive Self-Regard Tendency__<br>
We all commonly observe the excessive self-regard of man. He mostly misappraises himself on the high side [...] Such misappraisal also apply to a person's major "possession" [...] Once owned, they suddenly become worth more to him than he would pay if there were offered for sale to him and he didn't already own them. There is a name in psychology for this overappraise-your-own-possessiion phenomenon: the "endowment effect." And all man's decision are suddenly regarded by him as better than would have been the case just before he made them.

---
<br><br>
__Excessive Self-Regard Tendency effects on groups__<br>
Some of the worst consequences in modern life come when dysfunctional groups of cliquish persons, dominated by Excessive Self-Regard Tendency, select as new members of their organizations persons who are very much like themselves. Thus if the English department at an elite university becomes mentally dysfunctional or the sales department of a brokerage firm slips into routine fraud, the problem will have a natural tendency to get worse and to be quite resistant to change for the better. 

---
<br><br>
__Excessive Self-Regard Tendency effects on hiring__<br>
Excesses of self-regard often cuase bad hiring decisions because employers grossly overappraise the worth of their own conclusions that rely on impressions in face-to-face contact. The correct antidote to this sort of folly is to underweigh face-to-face impressions and overweigh the applicat's past record.

---
<br><br>
__Tolstoy on Excessive Self-Regard Tendency __<br>
According to Tolstoy, the worst criminal don't appraise themselves as all that bad. They come to believe either (1) that they didn't commit their crimes or (2) that, considering the pressures and disadvantages of their lives, it is understandable and forgivable that they behaved as they did and became what they became.

---
<br><br>
__Antidote of Excessive Self-Regard Tendency __<br>
Because a majority of mankind will try to get along by making way too many unreasonable excuses for fixable poor performance, it is very important to have personal and institutional antidotes limiting the ravages of such folly. On the personal level a man should try to face the two simple facts: (1) fixable but unfixed bad performance is bad character and tends to create more of itself, causing more damage to the excuse giver with each tolerated instance, and (2) in demanding places, like athletic teams and General Electric, you are almost sure to be discarded in due course if you keep giving excuses instead of behaving as you should. The main institutional antidotes to this part of the "Tolsroy effect" are (l) a fair, meritocratic, demanding culture plus personnel handling methods that build up morale and (2) severance of the worst offenders. Of course, when you can't sever, as in the case of your own child, you must try to fix the child as best you can.

---
<br><br>
__Antidote of Excessive Self-Regard Tendency __<br>
The best antidote to folly from an excess of self-regard is to force yourself to be more objective when you are thinking about yourself, your family and friends, your property, and the value of your past and future activity. This isn't easy to do well and won't work pefectly, but it will work much better than simply letting psychological nature take its normal course. While an excess of self-regard is often counter-productive in its effects on cognition, it can cause some weird successes from overconfidence that happens to cause success. This factor accounts for the adage: "Never underestimate the man who overestimate himself."

---
<br><br>
__Antidote to over-optimism tendency__<br>
One standard antidote to foolish optimism is trained, habitual use of the simple probability math of Fermat and Pascal [...]. The mental rules of thumb that evolution gives you to deal with risk are not adequate. They ressemble the dysfunctional golf grip you would have if you relied on a grip driven by evolution instead of golf lessons.

<br><br>
__Deprival-Superreaction Tendency__<br>
The quantity of man's pleasure from a ten-dollar gain does not exactly match the quantity of his displeasure from a ten-dollar loss. That is, the loss seems to hurt much more than the gain seems to help. Moreover, if a man almost gets something he greatly wants and has it jerked away from him at the last moment, he will react much as if he had long owned the reward and had it jerked away. I include the natural human reactions to both kinds of loss experience-the loss of the possessed reward and the loss of the almost-possessed reward-under
one description, Deprival-Superreaction Tendency.

<br><br>
__Deprival-Superreaction Tendency__<br>
The Mungers once owned a tame and good-natured dog that displayed the canine version of Deprival-Superreaction Tendency. There was only one way to get bitten by this dog. And that was to try and take some food away from him after he already had it in his mouth. If you did that, this friendly dog would automatically bite. He couldn't help it. Nothing could be more stupid than for the dog to bite his master. But the dog couldn't help being foolish. He had an autoamtic Deprival-Superreaction Tendency in his nature. Humans are much the same as this Munger dog, A man ordinarily reacts with irrational intensity to even a small loss, or threatened loss of property, love, friendship, dominated territory, opportunity, status, or any other valued thing.

__Tendency sustaining extreme ideology__<br>
It is almost everywhere the case that extremes of ideology are maintained with great intensity and with great antipathy to non-believers, causing extremes of cognitive dysfunction. This happens, I believe, because two psychological tendencies are usualy action concurrently toward this same sad result: (1) Iconsistency-Avoidance Tendency, plus (2) Deprival-Superreaction Tendency

__Deprival-Superreaction Tendency effect on labor relations__<br>
_Deprival-Superreaction Tendency has a ghastly effects in labor relations. Most of the deaths in the labor strife that occurred before World War l came when employers tried co reduce wages. Nowadays, we see fewer deaths and more occasions when whole companies disappear, as competition requires either takeaways from labor-which it will not consent to-or death of the business. Deprivai- Supcrreaction Tendency causes much of this labor resistance, often in cases where it would be in labor's interest to make a different decision.

__Social-Proof Tendency__<br>
The otherwise complex behavior of man is much simplified when he automatically thinks and does what he observes to be thought and done around him. And such followership often works fine. For instance, what simpler way could there be to find out how to walk to a big football game in a strange city than by fo llowing the flow of the crowd. For some such reason, man's evolution left him with Sociai-Proof Tendency, an automatic tendency to think and act as he sees others around him thinking and acting. <br>

Psychology professors love Social-Proof  Tendency because in their experiments it causes ridiculous results. For instance, if a professor arranges for some stranger tO enter an elevator wherein ten "compliance practitioners" are all silently standing so that they face the rear of the elevator, the stranger will oftcn turn around and do the same.

__Social-Proof on your people__<br>
Judith Rich Harris who demonstrated that superrespect by young people for their peers, rather than for parents or other adults, is ordained to some considerable extent by the genes of the young people. This makes it wise for parents to rely more on manipulating the quality of the peers than on exhhortations to their own offspring.

__Social-Proof Tendency trigger__<br>
When will Social-Proof Tendency be most easily triggered? Here the answer is clear from many experiments: Triggering most readily occurs in the presence of puzzlement or stress, and particulary when both exist.

__Serpico Effect__<br>
Not everyone so resists the social contagion of bad behavior. And, therefore, we often get "Serpico Syndrome," named to commemorate the state of a near-totally corrupt New York police division joined by Frank Serpico. He was then nearly murdered by gunfire because of his resistance to going along with the corruption in the division. Such corruption was being driven by social proof plus incentive, the combination that creates Serpico Syndrome. The Serpico story should be taught more than it now is because the didactic power of it's horror is aimed at a very important evil, driven substantially by a very important force: social proof.

__Lessons pertaining to Social-Proof Tendency__<br>
If only one lesson is to be chosen from a package of lessons involving Social-Proof Tendency, and used in self improvement, my favorite would be: Learn how to ignore the examples from others when they are wrong, because few skills are more worth having.

__Contrast-Misreaction Tendency__<br>
Contrast-Misreacrion Tendency is routinely used to cause disadvantage for customers buying merchandise and services. To make an ordinary price seem low, the vendor will very frequenntly create a highly artificial price that is much higher than the price always sought, then advertise his standard price as a big reduction from his phony price. Even when people know that this sort of customer manipulation is being attempted, it will often work to trigger buying.

__Contrast-Misreaction Tendency example__<br>
A buyer from out of the city, perhaps needing to shift his family there, ,visits the office with little time available. The salesman deliberately shows the customer three awful houses at ridiculously high prices. Then he shows him a merely bad house at a price only moderately too high. And, boom, the broker often makes an easy sale.

__Contrast-Misreaction Tendency small steps__<br>
When a man's steps are consecutively taken toward disaster, with each step being very small, the brain's contrast-misreaction tendency will often let the man go too far toward disaster to be able to avoid it. This happens because each step presents so small a contrast from his present position.

__Stress-Influence Tendency__<br>
In a phenomenon less well recognized but still widely known, light stress can slightly improve performance-say, in examinations-whereas heavy stress causes dysfunction.

__Effect of stress on Pavlov conditionning__<br>
Their habits had been transformed, by a combination of his "Pavlovian conditioning" plus standard reward responses, into distinct and different patterns. As the waters of the flood came up and reached,  many dogs reached a point where they had almost no airspace between their noses and the tops of their cages. This subjected them to maximum stress. Immediately thereafter, Pavlov noticed that many of the dogs were no longer behaving as they had. The dog that formerly had liked his trainer now disliked him, for example. This result reminds one of modern cognition reversals in which a person's love of his parents suddenly becomes hate, as  new love has been shifted suddenly to a cult. The unanticipated,  extreme changes in Pavlog dogs would have driven any good experimental scientist into a near-frenzy of curiosity. That was indeed Pavlov's reaction. But not many scientists would have done what Pavlov next did. And that was to spend the rest of his long life giving stress-induced nervous breakdowm to dogs after which he would try to reverse the breakdown,  all the while keeping careful experimental records. He found (1) that he could classify dogs so as to predict how easily a particular dog would breakdown; (2) that the dogs hardest to break down where also the hardest to return to their pre-breakdown state; (3) that any dog could be broken down; and (4) that he couldn't reverse a breakdown except by reimposing stress.

__Availability-Misweighing Tendency__<br>
This mental tendency echoes the words of the song: "When I'm not near the girl I love, I love the girl I'm near."

__Availability-Misweighing Tendency__<br>
The great algorithm to remember in dealing with this tendency is simple: An idea or a fact is not worth more merely because it is easily available to you.

__Availability-Misweighing Tendency Antidote__<br>
The main antidote to miscues from Availability-Misweighing tendency often involve procedures, including use of checklists, which are almost always helpful.

__Use-It-or-Lose-It Tendency__<br>
Throughout his life, a wise man engages in  practice of all his useful, rarely used skills, many of them outside his discipline, as a sort of duty to his better self. If he reduces the number of skills he practices and, therefore, the number of skills he retains, he will naturally drift into error from man-with-a-hammer tendency. His learning capacity will also shrink as he creates gaps in the latticework of theory he needs as a framework for understanding new experience. It is also essential for a thinking man to assemble his skills into a checklist that he routinely uses. Any other mode of operation will cause him to miss much that is important.

__Authority-Misinfluence Tendency__<br>
Living in dominance hierarchies as he does, like all his ancestors before him, man was born mostly to follow leaders, with only a few people doing the leading. And so, human society is formally organized into dominance hierarchies, with their culture augmenting the natual follow-the-leader tendency of man.

__Twaddle Tendency__<br>
A rightly famous Caltech engineering professor, exhibiting more insight than tact, once expressed his version of this idea as follows:"The pricipal job of an academic administration is to keep the people who don't matter from interfering with the work of the poeple that do."

__Reason-Respecting Tendency__<br>
It makes man especially prone to learn well when a would-be teacher gives correct reasons fo what is taught, instead of simply laying out the desired belief ex cathedra with no reasons given. Few practices, therefore, are wiser than not only thinking through reasons before giving orders ut also communicating there reasons to the recipient of the order.

<br><br>
__Exploiting Reason-Respecting Tendency__<br>
Unfortunately, Reason-Respecting Tendency is so strong that even a person's giving of meaningless or incorrect reasons will increase compliance with his orders and requests. This has been demonstrated in psychology experiments wherein "compliance practitioners" successfully jump to the head of the lines in front of copying machines by explaining their reason: "I have to make some copies." This sort of unfortunate byproduct of Reason-Respecting Tendency is a conditioned reflex, based on a widespread appreciation of the importance of reasons.

__Answering Why__<br>
In general, learning is most easily assimilated and used when, life long, people consistently hang their experience, actual and vicarious, on a lattice-work of theory answering the question: Why? Indeed, the question "Why?" is a sort of Rosetta stone opening up the major potentiality of mental life.

__Lollapalooza Tendency - The Tendency to Get Extreme Consequences from the Confluence of Psychological Tendencies Acting in Favor of a Particular Outcome__<br>
It accounts for the extreme result in the Milgram experiment and the extreme success of some cults that have stumbled through practice evolution into bringing pressure from many psychological tendencies to bear at the same time on conversion targets. The targets vary in susceptibility, like the dogs Pavlov worked with in his old age, but some of the minds that are targeted simply snap into zombiedom under cult pressure.

__Examples of usage Psychology Tendency__<br>
Tendency is not always destiny, and knowing the tendencies and their antidotes can often help prevent trouble that would otherwise occur. Here is a short list of examples reminding us of the great utility of elementary psychological knowledge: 

One: Carl Braun's communication practices. 

Two: The use of simulators in pilot training. 

Three: The system of Alcoholics Anonymous. 

Four: Clinical training methods in medical schools. 

Five: The rules of the U.S. Constitutional Convention: totally secret meetings, no recorded vote by name until the flnal vote, votes reversible at any time before the end of the convention, then just one vote on the whole Constitution.

Six: The use of Granny's incentive-driven rule to manipulate oneself toward better performance ofone's duties. 

Seven: The Harvard Business School's emphasis on decision trees. When I was young and foolish I used to laugh at the Harvard Business School. I said, "They're teaching twenty-eight-year-old people that high school algebra works in real life?" But later, I wised up and realized that it was very important that they do that to counter some bad effects from psychological tendencies.Better late than never. 

Eight: The use of autopsy equivalents at Johnson & Hohnson. At most corporations, if you make an acquisition and it turns out to be a disaster, all the people, paperwork, and presentations that caused the foolish acquisition are quickly forgotten. Nobody wants to be associated with the poor outcome by mentionning it. But at Johnson & Johnson, the rules make everybody revisit old acquisitions, comparing predictions with outcomes. That is a very smart thing to do. 

Nine: The great example of Charles Darwin as he avoided confirmation bias, which has morphed into the extreme anti-confirmation-bias method of the "double blind" studies wisely required in drug research by the FDA. 

Ten: The Warren Buffett rule for open-outcry auctions: Don't go.
