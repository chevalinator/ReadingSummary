The quotes below are what represents the essence of the book [Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition](https://www.amazon.ca/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Expanded-Hardcover/dp/1578645018). 

Some quotes have been sligtly modified to complete the meaning since they are sometimes taken out of context.

The emphasis represents the importance of the quote to me.

# Quotes
I think when you're trying to teach great concepts that work, it helps to tie them into the lives an personnalities of the people who developed them. I think you learn economics better if you make Adam Smith your friend. That sounds funny, making friends among 'the eminent dead,' but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life and work better in education. It's way better than just giving the basic concepts.

*Just as multiple factors shape almost every system, multiple models from a variety of disciplines, applied with fluency, are needed to understand a system.*

Charlie has developed an unusual additional attribute-a willingness, even an eagerness, to identify and acknowledge his own mistakes and learn from them. As he once said, "If Bershire has made a modest progress, a good deal of it is because Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year." 

<br><br>

Charlie likes the analogy of looking at one's ideas and approaches as "tools." "When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what couJd be better than to swap it for your old, less useful tool? Warren and I routinely do this, but most people, as Galbraith says, forever cling to their old, less useful tools."

__Charlie seek to discover the universe hitched to each of his investment candidates by gaining a firm grasp on all, or at least most, of the relevant factors comprising both its internal and external environment. When properly collected and organized, his Multiple Mental Models (about one hundred in number, he estimates) provide a context or " latticework" that leads to remarkable insights as to the purpose and nature of life. More pertinent to our purpose here, his models supply the analytical structure that enables him to reduce the inherent chaos and confusion of a complex investment problem into a clarified set of fundamentals. *Especially important examples of these models include the redundancy/backup system model from engineering, the compound interest model from mathematics, the breakpoint/tipping-moment/autocatalysis models from physics and chemistry, the modern Darwinian synthesis model from biology and cognitive misjudgment models from psychology.*__

 "Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not. It is the first lesson that ought to be learned and however early a man's training begins, it is probably the last lesson that he learn thoroughly."

__Often, as in this case, Charlie generally focuses first on what to avoid - that is, on what NOT to do - before he considers the affirmative steps he will take in a given situation.__

<br><br>

__"Personaly, I've gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions in various way - which, by and large, are useful - but which often malfunction? One approach is rationnality - the way you'd work out a bridge problem, by evaluating the real interest, the real probabilities, and so forth. And the other is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subcouscious conclusions - many are which are wrong."__

###### "We have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand." To identify potential "yes" candidates, Charlie looks for an easy to understand, dominant business franchise that can sustain itself and thrive in all market environments.

__Identifying Your circle of Competence__  
In Talk Nine (page 400), Charlie tells the apocryphal story of Max Planck and the chauffeur who drove him to the public lecture he gave throughout Germany. On one occasion the chauffeur, who by this time knew the lecture by heart, suggested that he and Planck switch places. At the conclusion of the chauffeur's flawless recitation of the lecture, a physicist stood up and posed a very difficult question. The chauffeur, ready for the situation, replied, "I'm surprised that a citizen of an advanced city like Munich is asking so elementary a question, so I'm going to ask my chauffeur ro respond." 
  
In the real world, it is critical to distinguish when you are "Max Planck," and when you are the "chauffeur." If you cannot respond legitimately to the *next* question, you lack true masrery and are likely outside your "Circle of Competence."

###### Munger and Buffer are laser-focused on this issue: Over their long business careers they have learned, sometimes painfully, that few businesses survive over multiple gnenerations.

###### Charlie seeks to calculate the intrinsic value of the whole business and, with allowance for potential dilution, etc., to determine an approximate value per share to compare to market prices. This latter comparison is the fundamental purpose of the whole process - comparing value (what you get) with price(waht you pay). On this subject he is famous for his viewpoint that "a great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price." Warren Buffett often credits Charlie with convincing him of the wisdom of this approach: "Charlie understood this early. I was a slow learner." Charlie's insight helped Buffett move from pure Benjamin Graham-style investing to focusing on great businesses such as The Washington Post, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Gillette, and others.
