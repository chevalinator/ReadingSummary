The quotes below are what represents the essence of the book [Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition](https://www.amazon.ca/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Expanded-Hardcover/dp/1578645018). 

Some quotes have been sligtly modified to complete the meaning since they are sometimes taken out of context.

The emphasis represents the importance of the quote to me.

# Quotes
I think when you're trying to teach great concepts that work, it helps to tie them into the lives an personnalities of the people who developed them. I think you learn economics better if you make Adam Smith your friend. That sounds funny, making friends among 'the eminent dead,' but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life and work better in education. It's way better than just giving the basic concepts.

*Just as multiple factors shape almost every system, multiple models from a variety of disciplines, applied with fluency, are needed to understand a system.*

Charlie has developed an unusual additional attribute-a willingness, even an eagerness, to identify and acknowledge his own mistakes and learn from them. As he once said, "If Bershire has made a modest progress, a good deal of it is because Warren and I are very good at destroying our own best-loved ideas. Any year that you don't destroy one of your best-loved ideas is probably a wasted year."

Charlie likes the analogy of looking at one's ideas and approaches as "tools." "When a better tool (idea or approach) comes along, what couJd be better than to swap it for your old, less useful tool? Warren and I routinely do this, but most people, as Galbraith says, forever cling to their old, less useful tools."

__Charlie seek to discover the universe hitched to each of his investment candidates by gaining a firm grasp on all, or at least most, of the relevant factors comprising both its internal and external environment. When properly collected and organized, his Multiple Mental Models (about one hundred in number, he estimates) provide a context or " latticework" that leads to remarkable insights as to the purpose and nature of life. More pertinent to our purpose here, his models supply the analytical structure that enables him to reduce the inherent chaos and confusion of a complex investment problem into a clarified set of fundamentals. *Especially important examples of these models include the redundancy/backup system model from engineering, the compound interest model from mathematics, the breakpoint/tipping-moment/autocatalysis models from physics and chemistry, the modern Darwinian synthesis model from biology and cognitive misjudgment models from psychology.*__

 "Perhaps the most valuable result of all education is the ability to make yourself do the thing you have to do, when it ought to be done, whether you like it or not. It is the first lesson that ought to be learned and however early a man's training begins, it is probably the last lesson that he learn thoroughly."  
                         -Thomas Henry Huxley Darwin's self-appointed advocate or "bulldog"

__Often, as in this case, Charlie generally focuses first on what to avoid - that is, on what NOT to do - before he considers the affirmative steps he will take in a given situation.__

__"Personaly, I've gotten so that I now use a kind of two-track analysis. First, what are the factors that really govern the interests involved, rationally considered? And second, what are the subconscious influences where the brain at a subconscious level is automatically forming conclusions in various way - which, by and large, are useful - but which often malfunction? One approach is rationnality - the way you'd work out a bridge problem, by evaluating the real interest, the real probabilities, and so forth. And the other is to evaluate the psychological factors that cause subcouscious conclusions - many are which are wrong."__

###### "We have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand." To identify potential "yes" candidates, Charlie looks for an easy to understand, dominant business franchise that can sustain itself and thrive in all market environments.

__Identifying Your circle of Competence__  
In Talk Nine (page 400), Charlie tells the apocryphal story of Max Planck and the chauffeur who drove him to the public lecture he gave throughout Germany. On one occasion the chauffeur, who by this time knew the lecture by heart, suggested that he and Planck switch places. At the conclusion of the chauffeur's flawless recitation of the lecture, a physicist stood up and posed a very difficult question. The chauffeur, ready for the situation, replied, "I'm surprised that a citizen of an advanced city like Munich is asking so elementary a question, so I'm going to ask my chauffeur ro respond." 
  
In the real world, it is critical to distinguish when you are "Max Planck," and when you are the "chauffeur." If you cannot respond legitimately to the *next* question, you lack true masrery and are likely outside your "Circle of Competence."

<br><br>

###### Munger and Buffer are laser-focused on this issue: Over their long business careers they have learned, sometimes painfully, that few businesses survive over multiple gnenerations.

---
<br><br>

###### Charlie seeks to calculate the intrinsic value of the whole business and, with allowance for potential dilution, etc., to determine an approximate value per share to compare to market prices. This latter comparison is the fundamental purpose of the whole process - comparing value (what you get) with price(waht you pay). On this subject he is famous for his viewpoint that "a great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price." Warren Buffett often credits Charlie with convincing him of the wisdom of this approach: "Charlie understood this early. I was a slow learner." Charlie's insight helped Buffett move from pure Benjamin Graham-style investing to focusing on great businesses such as The Washington Post, GEICO, Coca-Cola, Gillette, and others. 

---
###### By the time he is finished with his analysis, he has reduced the candidate to its most salient elements and achieved a remarkable degree of confidence about whether or not to act. The evaluation finally, becomes not so much mathematical as philosophical. Ultimately "a feel" emerges, a function of both the analysis itself and Charlie's lifetime of accumulated experience and skill in recognizing patterns.

"I notice that when all a man's information is confined to the field in which he is working, the work is never as good as it ought to be. A man has to get perspective, and he can get it from books or from people-preferably from both." -Harvey Firestone

__Charlie Sums It Up__ 
"How do some people get wiser than other people? Partly it is inborn temperament. Some people do not have a good temperament for investing. They're too fretful; they worry too much. But if you've got a good temperament, which basically means being very patient, yet combine that with a vast aggression when you know enough to do something, then you just gradually learn the game, partly by doing, partly by studying. Obviously, the more hard lessons you can learn vicariously, instead of from your own terrible experiences, the better off you will be. I don't know anyone who did it with great rapidity. Warren Buffett has become one hell of a lot better investor since the day I met him, and so have I. If we had been frozen at any given stage, with the knowledge hand we had, the record would have been much worse than it is. So the game is to keep learning, and I don't think people are going to keep learning who don't like the learning process."

###### What I say is that McDonald's is one of our most admirable institutions. Then, as signs of shock come to surrounding faces, I explain that McDonald's, providing first jobs to millions of teenagers, many troubled, over the years, has successfully taught most of them the one lesson they most need: to show up reliably for responsible work. Then I usually go on to say that if the elite campuses were as successful as McDonald's in teaching sensibly, we would have a better world.

At Harvard Business School, the great quantitative thing that bonds the first-year class together is what they call "decision tree theory." All they do is take high school algebra and apply it to real life problems. And the students love it. They're amazed to find that high school algebra works in life.

###### His rule for all the Braun Company's commnunications was called the five W's - you had to tell who was going to do what, where, when, and why. And if you wrote a letter or directive in the Braun Company telling somebody to do something, and you didn't tell him why, you could get fired. In fact, you would get fired if you did it twice. 

---
<br><br>
###### You might ask why is that so important? Well, again, that's a rule of psychology. Just as you think better if you array knowledge on a bunch of models that are basically answers to the question, why, why, why, if you always tell people why, they'll understand it better, they'll consider it more important, and they'll be more likely to comply. Even if they don't understand your reason, they' ll be more likely to comply.

###### The perceptual apparatus of man has shortcuts in it. The brain cannot have unlimited circuitry. So someone who knows how to take advantage of those shortcuts and cause the brain to miscalculate in cercain ways can cause you to see things that aren't there.

The elementary part of psychology-the psychology of misjudgment, as I call it-is a terribly important thing to learn.

###### Change, as in the case of the Internet, can be the friend of society. But it is the absence of change that is often the friend of the investor. While the Internet will change many things, it will not likely change the brand of gum people chew. Charlie and I like stable businesses like chewing gum and try to leave life's more unpredictable things to someone else." -Buffett

<br><br>
###### And in a bureaucracy, you think the work is done when it goes out of your in-basket into somebody else's in-basket. But, of course, it isn't. It is  not done until AT&T delivers what it's supposed to deliver. So you get big, fat, dumb, unmotivated bureaucracies. 

---
<br><br>
###### They also tend to become somewhat corrupt. In other words, if I've got a department and you've got a department and we kind of share power running this thing, there's sort of an unwritten rule: "If you won't bother me, I won't bother you, and we're both happy" So you ger layers of management and associated costs that nobody needs. Then, while people are justifying all these layers, it takes forever to get anything done. They're too slow to make decisions, and nimbler people run circles around them.

<br><br>

If people tell you what you really don't want to hear - what's unpleasant- there's an almost automatic reaction of antipathy. You have to train yourself out of it. It isn't foredestined that you have to be this way. But you will tend to be this way if you don't think about it.

<br><br>

So life is an everlasting battle between those two forces - to get those advantages of scale on one side and a tendency to get a lot like the U.S. Agriculture Departmemt on the other side- where they just sit around and so forth.

<br><br>

###### Here's a model that we've had trouble with. Maybe you'll be able co figure it out better. Many markets get down to two or three big competitors- or five or six. And in some of those markets, nobody makes any money to speak of. But in others, everybody does very well.

<br><br>
###### The great lesson in microeconomics is to discriminate between when technology is going to help you and when it's going to kill you. And most peopk do not get this straight in their heads. But a fellow like Buffett does. 

###### For example, when we were in the textile business, which is a terrible commodity business, we were making low-end textiles- which are a real commodity product. And one day, the people came to Warren and said, "They've invented a new loom that we think will do twice as nwch work as our old ones." And Warren said, "Gee, I hope th is doesn't work-because if it does, l'm going to close the mill." And he meant it. What was he thinking? He was thinking, "It's a lousy business. we are earning substandard returns and keeping it open just to be nice to the elderly workers. But we're not going to put huge amounts of new capital into a lousy business." 

###### And he knew that the huge productivity increases that would come from a better machine introduced into the production of a commodity product will all go to the benefit of the buyers of the textiles. Nothing was going to stick to our ribs as owners. [...]. The cost reduction came through all right. But the benefit of the cost reductions didn't go to the guy who bought the equipment. It's such a simple idea, It's so basic. And yet it's so often forgotten.

So you have to figure out what your own aptitude's are. If you play games where other people have the aptitudes and you don't, you're going to lose. And that's as close as certain as any prediction that you can make. You have to figure out where you've got an edge. And you've got to play within your own circle of competence.

 If you want to be the best tennis player in the world, vou may start out trying and soon find out that it's hopeless- that other people blow right by you. However, if you want to become the best plumbing contractor in Bemidji, that is probably doable by two-thirds of you. It takes a will. It takes the intelligence. But after a while, you'd gradually know all about the plumbing business in Bemidji and master the art. That is an attainable objective, given enough discipline.And people who could never win a chess tournament or stand in center court in a respectable tennis tournament can rise quite high in life by slowly developing a circle of competence- which results partly from what they were born with and partly from what they slowly develop through work.

###### The model I like - to sort of simplify the notion of what goes on in a market for common stock - is the pari-mutuel system at the race track. If you stop to think about it, a pari-mutuel system is a market.  Everybody goes there and bets, and the odds change based on what's bet. That's what happen in the common stock market

<br><br>
###### How many insisghts  do you need? Well, I'd argue that you don't need many in a lifetime. If you look at Berkshire Hathaway and all of its accumulated billions, the top ten insights account for most of it.

---
<br><br>
###### So you can get very remarkable investment results if you think more like a winning pari-mutuel player. Just think of it as a hevy  odds against game full of bullshit and crazyness with an occasional mispriced something or other. And vou're probably nor going to be smart enough to find thousands in a lifetime. And when you get a few, you really load up. It's just that simple.

<br><br>
I think the reason whv we got into such idiocy in investment management is best illustrated by a story that I tell about the guy who sold fishing tackle. I asked him, "My God, they're purple and green. Do fish really take these lures?" And he said, "Mister, I don't sell to fish." 

---
<br><br>
As usual in human affairs, what determines the behavior are incentives for the decision maker, and "getting the incentives right" is a very, very important lesson. 

---
<br><br>
###### All right, we've now recognized that the market is efficient as a pari-mutuel system is efficient-with the favorite more likely than the long shot to do well in racing, but not necessarily given any betting advantage to those that bet on the favorite. 

###### In the stock market. some railroad that beset by better competitors and rough union may be available at one-third of its book value. In contrast. IBM in its heyday might be selling at six times book value. So it's just like the pari-mutuel system. Any damn fool could plainly see that IBM had better business prospects than the railroad. But once you put the price into the formula, it wasn't so clear anymore what was going to work best for a buyer choosing between the stocks. So it's a lot like a pari-mutuel system. And, therefore, it gets very hard to beat. 

---
<br><br>

###### the best part of it all was his concept of "Mr. Market." Instead of thinking the market was efficient, Graham treated it as a maniac-depressive who comes by every day. And some day "Mr. Market" says, "I'll sell you some of my interest for way less than you think it os worth." And other d;tys. he comes by and says, "I'll buy your interest ar a price that's way higher than you think it's worth." And you get the option of deciding whether you want to buy more, sell part of what you already have, or do nothing at all. 

---
<br><br>
##### Over the long term, it's hard for a stock to earn a much better return than the business which underlies it earns. If the business earns six percent on capital over forty vears and you hold it for that forty years, you're not going to make much different than a six percent return-even if you originally buy it at a huge discount. Conversely, if a business earns eighteen percent on capital over twenty or thirty years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you'll end up with one hell of a result. 

---
<br><br>
##### However, averaged out, betting on the quality of a business is better than betting on the quality of management. In other words, if you have to choose one, bet on the business momentum, not the brillance of the manager.

__What overall life advice do you have for youg people?__
Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Step-by-step you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts. But you build discipline by preparing for fast spurts. Slug it out one inch at a time, day-by-day, and at the end of the day-if you live long enough-like most people, you will get out of life what you deserve.

Above all, live with change and adapt to it.

<br><br>
__As I said at the U.S.C Business School, what you need is a latticework of mental models in your head. And you hang your actual experience and your vicarious experience (that you get from reading and so forth) on this latticework of powerful models. And with that system, things gradually get to fit together in a way that enhances cognition.__

__You don't have to know it all. Just take in the best big ideas from all these disciplines. And it's not that hard to do.__ 

---
<br><br>
Similarly, I've told you to think forward and backward. Well, great declarers in bridge think, "How can I take the necessary winners?" But they think it through backwards, [ too. They also think, ] "What could possibly go wrong that could cause me to have too many losers? And both methods of thinking are useful. So [to win in] the game of life, get the needed models into your head and think it through forward and backward. What works in bridge will work in life.

And it's kind of fun to sit there and outthink people who are way smarter than you are because you've trained yourself to be more objective and multidisciplinary...

__Of all the models that people ought to have in useful form and don't, perhaps the most important lie in the area of psychology....__

<br><br>
Heavy ideology is one of the most extreme distorters of human cognition. Look at there Islamic fundamentalists who just gunned down a bunch of Greek tourists shouring, "God's work!" 

Ideology does some strange things and distorts cognition terribly. If you get a lot of heavy ideology young-and then you start expression it-you are really locking your brain into a very unfortunate pattern. And you are going to distort your general cognition. 
<br><br>
You can have heavy ideology in favor of accuracy, diligence, and objectivity. But a heavy ideology that makes you absolutely sure that the minimum wage should be raised or that it shouldn't-and it's kind of a holy construct where you know you're right-makes you a bit nuts. 

---
<br><br>
Well, I have far less in the way of qualifications than Pinker. In fact, I've never taken a single course in psychology. However, I've 
come to exactly the same conclusion-that the psychology texts, while thev are wonderful in pat, are also significantly daft. 

About three centuries before the birth of Christ, Demosthenes said, "What a man wishes, that also will he believe." Well, Demosrhencs 
was right.

<br><br>
Psychology to me, as currently organized, is like electromagnetism after Faraday but before Maxwell-a lot has been discovered, but no one mind has put it all together in proper form. And it should be done because it wouldn't be that hard to do-and it's enormously important.

"The live essential entrepreneurial skills for success are concentration, discrimination, organization, innovation, and conununication."

<br><br>
How can smart people be so wrong? Well, the answer is that they don't do what I'm telling you to do-which is to take all the main models from psychology and use them as a checklist in reviewing outcomes in complex systems.

---
<br><br>
__So you have to go back and put in your own head what I'd call the psychology of misjudgment in a form whereby you have all of the important models and you can use them.__ 

__There's only one right way to do it: You have to get the main doctrines together and use them as a checklist. And, to repeat for emphasis, you have to pay special attention to combinational effects that create lollapalooza consequences.__


---
<br><br>

__For example, take the issue of stealing. A very significant fraction of the people in the world will steal if (A) it's very easy to do and (B) there's practically no chance of being caught.__

__And once they start stealling, the consistency principle-which is a big part of human psychology-will soon combine with operant conditioning to make stealing habitual. So if you run a business where it's easy to steal because of your methods, you're working a great moral injury on rhe people who work for you.__

__Again, that's obvious. It's very, very important to create human systems that are hard to cheat. Otherwise, you're ruining your civilization because these big incentives will create incentive-caused bias and people will rationalize that bad behavior is OK.__ 

__Then, if somebody else does it, now you've got at least two psychological principles: incentive-caused bias plus social proof. Not only that, but you get Serpico effects: If enough people are profiting in a general social climate of doing wrong, then they' ll turn on you and become dangerous enem ies if you try and blow the whistle.__

Take the workers' compensation system in California. Stress is real. And its misery can be real. So you want to compensate people for their stress in the workplace. It seems like a noble thing to do. 

But the trouble with such a compensation practice is that it's practically impossible to delete huge cheating. And once you reward  cheating, you get crooked lawyers, crooked doctors, crooked unions, etc .. participating in referral schemes. You get a total miasma of disastrous behavior. And the behavior makes all the people doing it worse as they do it. So you were trying to help your civilization. But what you did was create enormous damage, net. 

So it's much better to let some things go uncompensated-to let life be hard-than to create systems that are easy to cheat.

##### What makes investment hard, as I said at U.S. C., is that it's easy to see that some companies have better businesses than others. But the price of the stock goes up so high that, all of a sudden, the question of which sto ~ck is the best to buy gets quite difficult.

#### As Buffett and I say over and over again, we don't leap seven-foor fences. Instead, we look for one-foot fences with big rewards on the other side. So we've succeeded by making the world easy for ourselves, not by solving hard problems.

<br><br>

#### And yes - a low-tech business can be plenty hard. Just try to open a restaurant and make it succeed.

__You must have the confidence to override people with more credentials than you whose cognition is impaired by incenrivc-caused bias or some similar psychological force that is obviously present.
