The quotes below are what represents the essence of the book [Poor Charlie's Almanack: The Wit and Wisdom of Charles T. Munger, Expanded Third Edition](https://www.amazon.ca/Poor-Charlies-Almanack-Expanded-Hardcover/dp/1578645018)


I think when you're trying to teach great concepts that work, it helps to tie them into the lives an personnalities of the people who developed them. I think you learn economics better if you make Adam Smith your friend. That sounds funny, making friends among 'the eminent dead,' but if you go through life making friends with the eminent dead who had the right ideas, I think it will work better for you in life and work better in education. It's way better than just giving the basic concepts.
