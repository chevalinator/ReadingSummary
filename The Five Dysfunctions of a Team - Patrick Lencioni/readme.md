2 greated causes for lack of commitment are desire for consensus and need to certainty.

Consensus: dangerous. Find way to achevie buyin even when consensus is not reach. reasonable humanbeing  dont need to get their way to rather that their opinion has ben heard and considered. Great team ensure that everyone ideas are considered which create willingness to rally around the decision made by the group. When impossible the leader of the team is allowed to make the call

Certainty: commit to clear course of action even though there is little insurance that the decision is correct. A decision is better than no decision. Better to make a decision boldly and be wrong and then change decision with equal boldness rather than it is to waffle. Dysfunctional edge their bet and can be dangerous because of the paralysis and lack of confidence that it brings. Oftentimes the team has all info needed but it must be extracted through healty debate.

- Low risk exposure therapy. Demonstration of deciseness in low risk situation. Decision might not have been that much better if longer time has been used.

Role of the leader: must be confortable with the prospect of making a decision that might be wrong. The leader must be constantly pushing the group toward closure of issues to respect deadline. Do not put too much importance on certainty and consensus.

### Avoidance of accountability

Unwillingness of team member to call their peer on performance or behaviors that might hurt the team. 

The most effective and efficient method of maintaining high standard of performance on a taem is peer pressure. One benefit is the need for excessive bureaucracy around management and corrective action.
